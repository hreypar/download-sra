# download-sra #

This module downloads data from NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). 

# Description #

The input is a table generated by the [Run Selector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?go=help)


**Warning:** it's under your responsiblity to select properly the files you want to download from SRA (e.g. if you check the same Run in different Run Selector queries and it ends up present in different SraRunTable files, the Run files will be downloaded as many times as it's present)


Three options:

find the fastq file link directly from the ENA mirror and use aspera like this
`ascp -v -QT -l 300m -P33001 -i ~/.aspera/connect/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR190/009/SRR1909069/SRR1909069_1.fastq.gz output/`

OR 

use `prefetch` and force it to use aspera to download .sra files, THEN convert them in the local to fastq using fastq-dump 

The FTP server has the data organised as follows:
sra/sra-instant/reads/ByRun/sra/SRR/SRRNNN/SRRNNNXXXX/SRRNNNXXXX.sra
Where NNN are the first three digits of the accession.


`prefetch --verbose --transport fasp --max-size 300G SRR1909069`

OR

use `fasterq-dump` but I don't know if this means we should check for integrity afterwards.

`fasterq-dump --verbose --progress --temp output/ --outdir output/ SRR1909069`


## About ##

This repository downloads paired-end [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) files from the 
[Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) using SRA accession identifiers.




## Requirements ##

- [mk](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man1/mk.html) from plan9. 

- [Aspera](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/8?list "IBM Aspera Connect is an install-on-demand application that facilitates high-speed uploads and downloads with an Aspera transfer server"). To install it, a shell script is downloaded and run. Afterwards, the executables default location is `$HOME/.aspera/connect/bin/`

- [fastq-dump](https://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/fastq-dump.html) from [SRA Tools](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/Building-and-Installing-from-Source)
